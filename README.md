# Overview

### Lab 1: Neural Network Implementation
A neural network implementation built from first principles, without relying on deep learning frameworks. The project includes complete implementations of forward propagation, backpropagation, and activation functions. The network was evaluated using both linear and XOR datasets, with experiments conducted across various learning rates and network architectures to analyze their impact on model performance.

### Lab 2: EEG Signal Classification
Implementation of SCCNet architecture for Motor Imagery based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The project explores EEG signal classification through multiple training approaches, including Subject-Dependent (SD) and Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) methodologies. The implementation demonstrates the challenges and solutions in cross-subject EEG signal classification.

### Lab 3: Semantic Segmentation
Development of two semantic segmentation models: UNet and ResNet34+UNet hybrid architecture. Both models were trained on the Oxford-IIIt pet dataset for binary semantic segmentation tasks. The implementation includes comprehensive image preprocessing pipelines and model evaluation protocols, demonstrating the effectiveness of different architectural approaches to image segmentation.

### Lab 4: Video Frame Prediction
A conditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) implementation focused on video frame prediction. The model utilizes previous frames and human pose data to predict subsequent frames. The implementation incorporates advanced training techniques including KL annealing and teacher forcing strategies to enhance model stability and performance.

### Lab 6: Image Generation with DDPM
Implementation of a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for synthetic image generation. The model demonstrates the capability to generate specific objects based on textual descriptions, achieving 77-79% accuracy on test datasets. The implementation showcases the application of diffusion models in controlled image generation tasks.
